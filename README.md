RSS Import
=================

An extension that allows users to select entries from an RSS Feed to import right in their sections.

The extension has 2 views. One with a list of remote datasources, and a second showing the RSS articles from the third party source using `remote datasource`. 
Articles can be highlighted and imported using a Symphony Layout, articles would then be created as entries within the desegnated sections.

This is currently experimental - if you want to use this kindly ask so that I can make the extension more usable than it currently is, as all fields & sections are currently hardcoded for proof of concept.
